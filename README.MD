## Hi
My name is Robert and if u are interested in looking up my portfolio.\
I made for u this website :)

Unfortunately projects does not scale well on mobile devices.

#### MADE IN .. REACT
* Uses ```react-router-dom``` for endpoints,.

* Home page was created with help of tutorial,\
rest of the views were I made myself (except icons)

#### ABOUT PROJECT
Project is in development stage,\
there's a lot stuf that I would love to add/improve,\
but for now I'm new to React and have other matters to attend,\
it is my first project deployed to the github pages.

I'm sure that there's a lot of misteps or things that could be done better\
I would be happy if someone could pinpoint them so later, I'll learn and know

Thank you for your time :)\
Have a nice day or !day
